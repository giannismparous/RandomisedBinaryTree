# RandomisedBinaryTree
A randomised binary tree coded in Java with all the basic methods and some extra methods. The project contains a program client, which is the menu for the user to edit the data in the Tree. It also contains a normal binary tree to accomplish changes while dynamically holding only k items (in our example, the items are the Suspects).
